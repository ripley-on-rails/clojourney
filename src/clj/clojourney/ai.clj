;; fun story about down and apple:
;; Gravitational Context: One of the most famous historical anecdotes involves an apple falling "down" from a tree, which led Isaac Newton to contemplate the force of gravity. This connection is deeply ingrained in the narrative of the discovery of gravitational theory.
;; Botanical Context: In a botanical context, the term "down" can refer to the soft, fine hair-like structures found on some plants or fruits, including certain types of apples. These fine hairs are sometimes present on the surface of the apple's skin.
